#Ideas

There are number of portals that allows users to post article to it. Users got fame, popularity and ability to refer to their products in their posts. But after some time this model do not work. New users abandon site after getting some experience and popularity. They go create their own sites and persists standalone from that point.

How could we heat up users interest on that. Itâ€™s widely known that that kind of portals makes money on advertisements. That means more article popular more money they get from user. But user gets nothing of it.

So solution is easy share part of advertisement revenue made on every post with the user. Though authors ables to make money and got some interest to make posts better and to post more. And portals from that point could increase data flow by dropping some percentage of cashflow in sake of authors.
