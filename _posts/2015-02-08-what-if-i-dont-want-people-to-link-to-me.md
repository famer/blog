Consider I have source of information and I want people read that kind of info only on my site. This strange request isn't that legal in some countries. But I don't want third persons to invert information providing link or make it place in bad placement. Even more consider you are holder of some product, let's say Git and you want to be 100% sure people get info about it from right source not crossposted and changed. You are not able to control environment and surroundings and even more context of the link in place it's places.

So from now on you've got some clue. Of such a strange idea. It kind of breaks origins of the web, back on when it was for scientific purposes and people used to link to another articles to provide proofs and context. That was cool when people link to you. That's the basis of Google's idea to range search results based on number of links to exact result and source of their money still as inventor of that.
But web changed. Actually `Google` doesn't relay on PageRank this days.

So you want to develop a users habit to visit your source in some particular category of info. How to perform it technically? Number of ways.

First you could publish it in some not that web friendly format, but still browser readable. Let's say it could be PDF or any Image format with text and graphics without any particular URL. Or even if it has some it already kind of breaks idea of the indexable, searchable and structured web.

Another one is usage of internet just for data transfer, but provide special tools or reuse existing for read your information. It could be mobile or desktop app, or it could be just a `RSS` feed with full info but without valid links to original articles. It could be even e-mail lists.

And third one that comes to my mind is more technical and traditional to the web one. For every article you could generate random links every time, so user able to go through the structure of your site, use categories and tags and find right article there, but links are temporal or even fakes(in case you don't need to provide extra information on separate page). And make it user friendly: for every enter on your site from others show user page describing that it's cool he come here but site doesn't support linkage so he could read info here and use navigation and search. It's better to make it 404 response so search-engines and crawlers as link checkers will threat response right. You could even provide full starting page with all the structure followed after that message, it's not SEO friendly but who cares our goal is vice-versa.

Drawbacks:
comments, you are going to implement your own connection to post-related info suck as comments, Most likely you wouldn't be able to use tools such as Disquss and etc.
GA: it's better to use your own analytics but still you could setup GA actions for every page to your own linkage such as hash of id.
