[![Pro Places App Icon]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/Apps/Pro Places/Icon_180.png)][pro-places]

I've decided to open sources of [Pro Places App][pro-places]. It's completely written in Swift excluding third party libraries for interface and available [Pro Places Source code](https://github.com/famer/Places).

I've been developing this app on `Swift` and having lack of information and resources on that relatively young but powerful language. So I've solved some problems during my way of development and feel need of sharing this experience with poleple who study it. It's going to be useful for you on following topics:

* Location Services
* MapKit and customization. Custom callout, custom pins.
* Delegation
* Protocols 
* Serialization
* App urls and app links
* Subclassing of standard classes
* Subclassing of developend classed
* Structures
* Callbacks

[Pro Places Application][pro-places] itself remains commercial product. Code published for educational poruses. You are able to use some parts of the sources in your commercial projects. You are not able to use project completely for new app.

You are not able to use full codebase of the project for forks and creation of new app based on it.

You are able use it for personal purposes on your own devices without limitations.

Main goal is education and study of Swift programming language and sharing problem solving codebase.
