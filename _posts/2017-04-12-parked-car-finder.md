It's been a while since I've relised [my first smart phone app -- 2012 year](http://timurtatarshaov.me/projects/app/megafinder.html) It's goal was to help people find parked car on the parking lot. Then it [was moved to iPhone](http://timurtatarshaov.me/projects/app/spottyfinder.html).  
Now Apple releases it's new iOS version -- [iOS 10](http://appleinsider.com/articles/16/06/14/inside-ios-10-apple-maps-will-remember-where-you-parked-your-car) 5 years later, that does the same. And just recently goog releases same functions for [Google Maps](https://techcrunch.com/2017/03/20/google-maps-lets-you-record-your-parking-location-time-left-at-the-meter/).
