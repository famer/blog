It's interesting to look how government institutes make their identity which in business world knows as `branding`.

Such a big institute is `European government` for example, so take a look at their [**Visual identity** page](http://ec.europa.eu/dgs/communication/services/visual_identity/index_en.htm) along with their [logo page reference(PDF 1.7 MB)]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/visual-logo_en.pdf)

That level of perception about colors, fonts and spacing is something worth to see.
