![site welcome based on quick registration]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/Usability/Ideas/Get_the_Share_Button_-_ShareThis.png)

Many sites trying to increase users happiness by shortening registration process. And that's good.

User just types email and password and that's it. He or she are registered. Bad thing for site -- it doesn't know anything about the user and messages like on picture have to be present:

> Welcome, dannyman358@email.com

But it's not cozy people are not email and I don't like that.

I prefer site to welcome me like it should. So what can be done here?

People are used to have names or surnames as parts of their emails. So it could be parsed, compared to names list and if found something predict that it's users name.

But I would be scared if once registered on the website it will call me by name without me providing that info.

Solution could be following.
Highlight part of the user email predicted to be name like:

* Welcome, `Danny`man358@email.com
or
* Welcome, mr/s. shugar`Brown`@email.com 

Would you like it more?
