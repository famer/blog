_Apple Watch Break-Through Technology_


Since long time Smartphones came to substitute usual mobile phone people were struggling to detect touch on the right place of the big functional screen of Smartphone. With old style buttons everything was clear, one could find button by it’s shape and physical form and be sure it’s touched hearing click and tactical response of the button.

Smartphones solved problem of placing information and functions on the interactions position but, since then technology was not successful to provide qualitative feedback to the user of the device, as far as screen showing quality information was not able to do that.

There were some attempts to fix that resistive screens makes you feel a little bit of tactical response, but not big enough and doesn’t support multi-touch. Recent solutions on some Smartphone is utilization of vibration of the phone when screen is touched which is not bad.

But looks like Apple going to go far with Apple Watch citing:

>Whenever you receive an alert or notification, or perform a function like turning the Digital Crown or pressing down on the display, you feel a tactile sensation that’s recognizably different for each kind of interaction.

It’s called `Taptic Engine`. That’s going to be break-through in that field. It’s tied to your wrist, so you wouldn’t able to miss when Watch taps on it. It’s going to perform different response depending on action or interactions, so wearer able to distinguish between them because of close contact with users wrist. Finally gap between functional but woody screens and user tactical experience going to be covered by this bridge. Hoping they’ll do it right as usual.

Another feature that takes advantage of being on users hand all the time is actually taken from different kind of fitness bracelets. Being tied to wearer they could provide a lot of useful information about users movements, heart rate, health and give suggestions about them. Phone could be in the pocket, on the table, left at home and even with user all the time battery goes empty calculating those parameters all the time. Watch solves those problems. 

##Conclusion 

Apple Watch going to be useful thing being on the wearers hand all the time. Critical points here are size, weight and battery life. Users not going to wear it if it’s not comfortable and moreover it’s not going to be useful and complete without being able perform needed actions all the time.
Physical parameters are what Apple successfully solve in their products and it becomes feature people like, but I still forced to carry external charger for my iPhone having a lot of usage of camera and GPS what is needed for Watches health measurements and suggestions. Hopefully they’ll find proper balance between those parameters and make it usable.
