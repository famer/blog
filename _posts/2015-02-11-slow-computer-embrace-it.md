Computers are slow since people use them. More precise since people expect human related tasks to be done out of it. Decades ago wardrobe-sized computers were calculating numbers for hours and days and everyone was satisfied.

Contemporary people consider computers slow expecting them to solve human related problems. Problems like face recognition, shapes detection, qualitative translation. But what is slow? Everything is relative isn't it? Trees would consider they grow fast and humans move with super sonic speeds. So you think computer is slow when it's solving human task for a longer time than it would take for human. And you have to love it. It's fine.

Because the day computers would solve human sized problems in human comparable time they wouldn't need them. And with a knowledge of the world in small sized storage and connectivity around the globe they would do better.

Computer is slow? Embrace it.
