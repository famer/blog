Buffet invested over $1bn in Apple. And industry trends.  
  
After leave of Steve Jobs and couple generations of products afterwards many people started to complain that Apple company isn't as it was and there is no innovation anymore. 
Thats different from what I see.   
From my point of view Apple is still the same company, but without a previous leader that's it. Proof of that is a Force Touch technology, which from my perspective is amazing thing with a confluence of technology and software, what was the best tradition of the company for many years. Taptic Engine supporting that with help of the proper visualization and functions is something that wasn't on a market before.  
And investors moves even though it's not that big deal for the holder company is to support that and I'm happy to see that.
