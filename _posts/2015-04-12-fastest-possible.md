title: Fastest possible
---

This post is inspired by recent [Linus Torvalds interview related to Git development](http://www.linux.com/news/featured-blogs/185-jennifer-cloer/821541-10-years-of-git-an-interview-with-git-creator-linus-torvalds).

But even it's about tech, post is going to be more psychological and related to computers of course.

So the thing is what people consider as appropriate related to some process in terms of speed and quality. Thought flow is following: git is written in C it's one of the fastest languages known after things like ASM by definition so far. So it allows to process large repositories with fastest possible speed.

Now imagine it's done in Python. Everything is ok, but you would feel it could do faster and it's critical with large codebases.

What was considered to be fast in epoch of dial-up modems 56 Kb right?
Slower was 33.6 Kb. Would you consider it fast now, no for sure.

Would you consider 100Mb as a fast speed now? Yes, because there is no existence of faster, try to ask yourself later.

So there are cases when speed and time is critical and users expect it to be as fast as possible with a current state of technologies.
