[![Pro Places App Icon]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/Apps/Pro Places/Icon_180.png){:.rounded}][pro-places]

I've decided to open sources of [Pro Places App][pro-places]. It's completely written in Swift excluding third party libraries for interface and available [Pro Places Source code](https://github.com/famer/Pro-Places).

I've been developing this app on `Swift` and having lack of information and resources on that relatively young but powerful language. So I've solved some problems during my way of development and feel need of sharing this experience with poleple who study it. It's going to be useful for you on following topics:

* Location Services
* MapKit and customization. Custom callout, custom pins.
* Delegation
* Protocols 
* Serialization
* App urls and app links
* Subclassing of standard classes
* Subclassing of developend classed
* Structures
* Callbacks
