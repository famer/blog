title: You are what you eat. Acquisition.

There is such a thing as company culture, that exists in a big and small corporations. Big companies have to care about it more, because it makes a rhythm for all the employees.
That’s why departments within the companies create brandbooks and guidelines for premises and way of settling the things in the workspace, including slogans on the walls, colors of the floors and content that should be created inside the offices like internal newspapers, magazines and subscriptions.

This thing is quite important and even though every employee is a unique person they as staff of the same company have something in common.
Referencing some people for internal positions and imagining candidates in the offices and compare if they fit is a sign of it. There are even some guidelines in many companies for internal staff to check before they want to recommend someone.
What happens if company acquires another one, that existed already for couple of years? Internal cultures most likely won’t fit. 

And it’s not certain what should be done with such a differences. On one hand there is possibility to teach new member culture of the acquisitor, but on the other hand there is no clarity what it could do to the acquired company. It could break inner processes completely or create dissonance in the values of the people who were driving the company before.

For instance, Facebook, having bought companies like WhatUp or Instagram, provided them with necessary contacts and resources, still keeping them separately and not to interfere with their way of making things.
