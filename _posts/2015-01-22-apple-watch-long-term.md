Apple Watch

They key of experience and success is to do gradually steps perceiving final destination.

Now I’m reading Apple product statement about Apple Watch. New product thats right, some of the on the market for long time but still entirely new from Apple. Eyes caught following line of description.

>«From the moment you wake the display with a simple raise of the wrist» 

This feature to work requires constant work of accelerometer, which detects orientations changes of your device in space. Constant work requires energy consumption. After that strange feature was recalled. 

Some time ago even in iOS 6-something yet Apple incorporated strange feature to standard Applications, Music for instance. It’s following: volume slider has some metal structure, reflection on it was changing depending on rotation and movement of your device in your hand. Same thing — feature requires full time accelerometer work. It was funny but useless and not that eye-catching because people usually not often leave Music app opened and even less give attention to the volume slider. So probably engineers were testing power consumption and other parameters of constantly accelerometer on mode. 

Some mystery resolved when Apple released iOS 7 with parallax wallpapers mode: position of your wallpaper and icons depend on same things movement of your device and giving you some volume perception on the flat screen. Since than, when setting on, which is default, accelerometer was working not only in standard Applications, but on every home screen and even on lock screen. Looks like power consumption tests were satisfiable.

Ok what’s next. In Apple Watch your accelerometer works constantly: not only in standard Applications, not only on Home and Lock Screens, — it works all the time to detect your wrist position. When device position alike you’re looking on it, screen enables. That obviously helps device to save more energy in contracts to have it always on, even in couple with processor and program to detect and filter right device movements from others.
