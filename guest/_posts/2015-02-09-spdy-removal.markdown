SPDY was developed as alternative to HTTP/1.1 protocol as faster mean of network communications by `Google`. It's [supported by majority of contemporary browsers](http://caniuse.com/#feat=spdy) 

Since HTTP/2 developed and took
> Some key features such as multiplexing, header compression, prioritization and protocol negotiation 

out of SPDY and it going to be standard `Google` decided to cancel support for SPDY and say goodbye to it.

Great job. I personally know some startups that decided to use SPDY as one of the features of their products and were astonished by results of tests.
So happy companies like Google have free resources and able to use them for development of something big valuable and for free.

UPDATE(19.02.2015):

[HTTP/2 is out](https://www.mnot.net/blog/2015/02/18/http2)
