When human being growths s/he learns how to interact with this physical world. If you'd watch the child you'll find out how this process goes.  

Physical world is a basis and every additional thing is subject to learn and subject of additional educational process and experience. Will it be law, music, art or others.   

On one of the latest Apple Keynotes Tim Cook from stage said:  

> «When we made first iPhone it was nephew and skeuomorphic design was needed to help people to interact with the smartphone by use of means of a real life objects, now it could be replaced with flat design since users are educated.»  

That was said obviously after Steve Jobs gone.  

Recently I've watched my 40 years old friend searching info on the web. Some field has a text inside profiled, that what’s called a place holder, he pointed to the filed and started to press backspace to erase the text there.   
That was an eye opener for me.  

This is simple, people, who develop new interfaces make predictions based on their experience and experience of existing users, putting preferences and habits of new-coming and old users aside.  

Physical world interactions is a only basic thing every human has if s/he still alive by the age of 3. There are generations of new human beings who has experience of such devices from the childhood, but I assume they will still have troubles moving from one platform to another.  

This post is to make you think of it and to consider that even though we are people, who develop future of the interfaces, including web and mobile(most spread ones) there are some who are from the different areas, so let's make smart world comfortable for them as well and make barrier of smart world lower.

Addition: definitely mentioned categories of users are not a market makes for producers like Apple, so they could be ignored for those reasons. But in that case taking so much care about accessibility options for disabled people looks uncertain.

Thank you,
