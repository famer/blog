This blog runs on [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) and hosted on [GitHub pages](http://pages.github.com/) for now.

It works perfectly and satisfy conditions until now. But I met one request as date localization which is not covered by default Jekyll functional.

This article explains perfectly how to customize date and make some localization for it.
