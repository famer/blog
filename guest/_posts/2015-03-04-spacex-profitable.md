Long time ago former co-founder of PayPal Elon Musk set an ambitious goal _to make it into space_ to make space travels cheaper and made a company SpaceX. First attempts to build low-cost solutions were not very successful, several shuttles fall or were not able to accomplish the goal of it.
But finally SpaceX group made a promising stable results and just now got government contracts worth $4.2 billion for delivering astronauts and supplies to the International Space Station.

Google made investments to the company willing to spread Internet to distinct regions by means of SpaceX satellites. Elon says his company able to send satellites to space for $60 million which is much cheaper that government used to spend to it.
Key of savings is reusable rockets.
