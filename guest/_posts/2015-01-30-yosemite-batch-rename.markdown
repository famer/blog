Apart of fancy stuff in new OS X system called Yosemite, there is one usefull one.

Lately I was in search of native feature and latter some third-party to batch rename my files. I end up on writing small bash script which did what I wanted.

And finally this feature came to Yosemite.

I probably could not know that it's there because it's not some kind of big things Apple annonce from the stage and bloggers discuss later.
